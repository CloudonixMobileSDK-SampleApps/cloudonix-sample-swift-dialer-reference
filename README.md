# Cloudonix SDK Swift Demo Application

To build and run the demo:

1. Download the Cloudonix Mobile SDK for iOS and your Cloudonix SDK license key.
2. From the Cloudonix SDK distribution, copy the `libraries` and `include` folders into the `CloudonixSDK` folder.
3. copy your license file to `license-key.lic` (or change the text in KeypadViewController.swift, like 122 to match your file name).
4. Open the project settings, select the target and under "Copy Bundle Resources", click "+", then "Add Other..." then find and add the license key.

The project can now be run in the simulator or an iOS device.
